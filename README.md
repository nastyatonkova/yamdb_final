## YaMDb Service

The YaMDb project collects user reviews of works. 
The works are divided into categories: "Books", "Films", "Music". 
The list of categories can be expanded by the administrator.


## Technologies

- Docker
- Simple-JWT
- PostgreSQL
- nginx
- gunicorn


## Launching app in container

Clone the repository and go to it on the command line:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:nastyatonkova/yamdb_final.git
cd yamdb_final
```

Then go to the infra_sp2/infra folder and create there a .env file with 
environment variables needed for the application to work.
```
cd infra/
```

An example of the file contents:
```
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
DB_NAME=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
SECRET_KEY=key
```

The next step is to run docker-compose: 
```
docker-compose up -d
```
The necessary applications will be created and run in the background 
containers (db, web, nginx).

Then you have to perform migrations inside the web container, create 
superuser and build statics:
```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --no-input 
```
After that the project should be available at http://localhost/. 

### Filling out the database

You need to go to http://localhost/admin/, log in and make entries 
into the database through the admin panel.

You can create a backup copy of the database with the command.
```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py dumpdata > fixtures.json 
```

### Stopping containers

To stop the application you can type Ctrl+C in the terminal 
or open a second terminal and use the command
```
docker-compose stop 
```
It is also possible to start containers without creating them again with the command
```
docker-compose start 
```

### User roles
 - Anonymous — can view descriptions of works, read reviews and comments.
 - Authenticated user (user) — can read everything, as well as Anonymous, can publish reviews and rate works (films / books / songs), can comment on reviews; can edit and delete their reviews and comments, edit their ratings of works. This role is assigned by default to each new user.
 - Moderator — the same rights as an Authenticated User, plus the right to delete and edit any reviews and comments.
 - Admin — full rights to manage all the content of the project. Can create and delete works, categories and genres. Can assign roles to users.
 - The Django superuser must always have administrator rights, a user with admin rights. Even if you change the user role of the superuser, it will not deprive him of administrator rights. A superuser is always an administrator, but an administrator is not necessarily a superuser.

### User registration algorithm
 - The user sends a POST request with the email and username parameters to the endpoint /api/v1/auth/signup/.
 -The YaMDB service sends an email with a confirmation code (confirmation_code) to the specified email address.
 - The user sends a POST request with the username and confirmation_code parameters to the endpoint /api/v1/auth/token/, in response to the request he receives a token (JWT token).
 - As a result, the user receives a token and can work with the project API by sending this token with each request.
 - After registering and receiving the token, the user can send a PATCH request to the endpoint /api/v1/users/me/ and fill in the fields in his profile (the description of the fields is in the documentation at the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/).
 
### Creating a user by an administrator
 - The user can be created by an administrator — through the site's admin zone or through a POST request to a special api endpoint/v1/users/ (the description of the request fields for this case is in the documentation).
 - - At this point, the user does not need to send an email with a confirmation code.
After that, the user must independently send his email and username to the endpoint /api/v1/auth/signup/, in response he should receive an email with a confirmation code.
 - Next, the user sends a POST request with the username and confirmation_code parameters to the endpoint /api/v1/auth/token/, in response to the request, he receives a token (JWT token), as with self-registration.

 ## Resources of the YaMDb API service
